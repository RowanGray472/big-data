1. last quiz that tests you on correctness of sql queries
2. no new sql material for pagila hw 3 and the lab
3. the problems are just harder
4. we care about schemas for disk space reasons- this helps us make queries fast too
5. how to make extra overhead
    1. overhead that doesn't store data- no penalties for getting rid of this
        1. row overhead
        2. page overhead
    2. redundant data
6. schema of the db is the most important part of the company- if you know the schema you know all their code
7. bad programmers care about code, good programmers care about data structures
8. on the quiz we're responsible to figure out how many bytes are used by a row of data in postgres
9. postgres has more overhead per row than other dbs- not that much  but adds up
    1. they care about simplicity and correctness more than efficiency
    2. we don't have to know this for other dbs
10. every row inserted has 3 parts
    1. header
        1. 23 byte structure called HeapTubleHeaderData
        2. null bitmap- 1 bit per column in table
        3. remembec- 8 bits in a byte and we only address bytes usually- so null bitmap is rounded up to bytes
        4. on 64 bit machine (all modern machines) we usually address 8 bytes at a time—means size of header must be divisible by 8
            1. if not add padding to make it div by 8
        5. so you get 8 columns for 24 bytes
        6. max of 256 columns per table
    2. data
        1. every column with non-null value requires bytes depending on column type
        2. null values consume 0 bytes disk space- pg knows they're not present bc of null bitmap
        3. `select typname,typalign,typlen from pg_type;` always gives you information- tells you how many bytes each data type stores per row
        4. the typlen just tells you how many bytes there are to stoer the data type
        5. typname is the name of the type
        6. negative length means the length is variable
        7. typalign- the alignment required when storing a value of this type
            1. certain datatypes can't exist in certain regions of memory
            2. you can have c-no alignment, s-2, i-4, d-8
            3. being aligned on a byte means that the end byte of the prev value must be a multiple of this number
                1. if it's not, add padding until it gets there
        8. order you put in columns determines storage and eventually runtime optimizations
        9. we're never going to be asked how many bytes a variable type takes up
    3. padding
        1. every row must be divisible by 8
11. sql has column relations
12. you can specify that a column is nullable using `NULL` and `NOT NULL`- still takes up space in the null bitmap though


1. next two weeks we're focusing on the hardest concept in computer science! concurrency
2. but after that the end of the semester shoudl be pretty fluffy
3. focus on extra credit stuff if you don't like your grade
4. quiz thursday is easier than previous sql quizzes if yuo know what's going on
    1. computers are allowed! - this will be true from all quizzes here on out
5. no lab this week bc cesar chavez day, and no hw
6. the references contain sql queries that solve the problems for you automatically- so read those so you don't have to think on the quiz
7. 3 more homeworks
    1. we're gonna analyze twitter using postgres
    2. the hard part is getting the data into postgres
    3. half of the points are still remaining in the class
8. all non-graduating students have an additional project that we'll talk about in a few weeks
9. reminders
    1. headers is always 23 bytes
    2. null bitmap has one bit per column in the table- if it exceeds 8 bit than the header is bigger than 24 bytes, has to be divisible by 8, so the header goes up to 32
    3. the real calculations are in the data- figure out how much in each
    4. and the overall row size has to be divisible by 8 so you need padding at the end
10. quiz
    1. two separate insert into table commands- how many does this take up?
    2. NEW- two create table commands- answer with the optimal ordering of rows to minimize disk space usage
11. to optimize disk usage
    1. order the columns from largest to smallest
12. if a type has a number in it, that's how many types it takes up
13. on the quiz a JSON is guaranteed to be null because he doesn't expect us to know how json disk space calculation works
14. you can't make id come first
15. why doesn't postgres automatically reorder columns? it's an open issue for someone to do this for them
16. if there's a tie in bytelength, the ordering doesn't matter
17. essentially all difficult bugs are concurrency bugs
18. concurrency- when multiple programs use the database at the same time
    1. this is easy for reading data- nothing special to worry about as a user
    2. for writing this is really hard
        1. embedded databases like sqlite3 don't support concurrent writes
            1. if someone asks you which rdbms to use, ask if you need concurrent writes
        2. this is why other databases are more complicated
        3. as a user there's a lot to worry about too
        4. this is a major source of nondeterminism- hard problem
        5. lots of research but not very many best practices
        6. there's impossibility theorems on concurrent writes too
    3. there's lots of tools to help you manage this-usually covered in operating systems courses
        1. semaphores, barriers, spinlocks, mutexes, etc.
        2. os-level tools are really hard to work with- so modern programing languages have specific behavior
            1. python most famously uses the asyncio module
            2. every new version since adding this module has been backwards incompatible
            3. check out the cs46 hw on this
        3. databases use transactions and locks to manage this
        4. the quiz on this- next thursday -  will be worth 16 points and seems like it's gonna be really hard
19. quiz
    1. any time there's a select statement we're required to write the output of that select statement
    2. if you just have an insert statement the output of those insert staetmens are available to all sessions- this is called a 'naked insert statement' or a 'bare insert statement'
    3. `BEGIN;` starts a 'transaction'- nothign is committed until you run `COMMIT;`
    4. `ROLLBACK;`  - forgets all the data you inserted in your `BEGIN` block
    5. remember, `SELECT` is idempotent
    6. `ABORT;` - in postgres these are identical, in other databases abort can signal an error
    7. up until now it's identical with sqlite- when we get to concurrent writes those don't work
        1. for the quiz we're only responsible for postgres though
    8. if you're inside a transaction you can see all the stuff that's publicly posted, but nothing that's privately posted
    9. when you start your transaction you can specify an isolation level
        1. if you set it to repeatable read it'll only read the data from when you ran your first select command
            1. NOT WHEN YOU STARTED THE TRANSACTION
        2. if you set it to read committed- it's the default one so it'll only read committed stuff
    10. postgres has 4 isolation levels but we don't need to know the other two


## Other Notes

This shows you the number of bits in each row for each column in a way that maximizes efficiency

```
SELECT a.attname, t.typname, t.typalign, t.typlen
  FROM pg_class c
  JOIN pg_attribute a ON (a.attrelid = c.oid)
  JOIN pg_type t ON (t.oid = a.atttypid)
 WHERE c.relname = 'YOUR TABLE NAME'
   AND a.attnum >= 0
 ORDER BY t.typlen DESC;
```

Doing aggregations can lead to major time and space efficiency improvements, but comes at the cost of losing relationality—maintaining a foreign key becomes impossible.
