## Relevant notes from class

24. echo prints to stdout - standard out
25. by default it's the screen - TTY - stands for teletype
26. `>>` redirects stdout to a file - appends
27. cat outputs content of a file
28. `|` is called a pipe - takes the output of a previous command and puts it into the right command
29. just running grep opens a new interface for you to type in so that it can search through it
30. `^` means control
31. grep outputs the whole line, if it contains the specified phrase
32. grep does two things - it loads a file and searches - this means it doesn't conform with unix philosophy
33. input redirection with < - pass contents of a file to the input of a program - so `< readme` is the same as `cat readme |`
34. `>` output redirection but deletes the contents of the file first


11. `^` - means beginning of line
12. `$` - means end of line
13. `wc -l`
    1. counts the total number of lines in stdin
    2. `wc` is word count, `-l` is a line modifier
14. if there's no output to a command on a quiz LEAVE THE PROBLEM BLANK
    1. he will take points off if you write 'there is no output'
15. `grep -E` tag
    1. allows extended regular expressions
    2. ie alternation operators
    3. when do you need the `-E`?
        1. check the grep manpage with man grep
        2. for now you can kinda ignore the `-E`
        3. it's about the minimal required syntax to make regex work- `|` isn't in it
16. inside of quotation marks, `|` is an alternation operator
17. for the quiz we have to know `^ $ . * |`
18. here document, heredoc - 
19. `<<EOF` - input redirection via a heredoc - when you run this it will take everything you type until you type EOF and redirect that input into the thing to the left
    1. `EOF` is traditional but you can use any combination of characters you want
    2. has to be an exact match, not regex
20. `!` isn't an exclamation point, it's a bang


10. making your shell prompt shorter - `export ps1='$ '`
11. idempotency - if a function has no effect and you can call it more than one time without changing the environment, it's idempotent
12. shell variable features
    1. no spaces around equals sign
    2. a string with spaces has to be in quotation marks
13. if you want to do a variable substitution you need a dollar sign in front of your variable
14. in shell, variable gets interpreted before passing the outcome to the terminal
15. in python, single and double quotes have the same meaning- not in terminal
16. in single quotes, variable expansion does not happen
17. in double quotes, it does!
18. `$()` is command subsitution- $ always means substitution, `()` means whatever is inside is run as if it were a function
19. so `var=$(echo echo echo)` runs `echo echo echo`, and puts the output in a file named `var`
20. concatenation is just smushing stuff together
21. putting curly braces around the variable is cool too
22. if you use a variable that doesn't exist you don't get an error message, it just subsitutes in an empty string
23. heredocs - we covered these last class
24. any time you do substitution in a shell instead of in double quotes, spacing gets ignored and it just all gets printed in one line
25. if you put single quotes around the EOF characters in the heredoc it ignores variable substitution
26. you can't substitute some variables and not others
27. new way of defining a varible
    1. `export {variable definition}`
    2. this makes the variable an environment variable- will get passed to all children processes
    3. any time you run a shell script, all the variables you exported exist inside of the child process and will get substituted correctly
    4. you can also make one by defining a variable in the same line as when you run a child process

## Notes from reviewing quizzes

if a line starts with `cat >` it's deleting everything in a file before something can get pumped in from the right

Variables never get passed from children to their parents. For a script to set a variable, the script must be sourced.

Just running the script, even if that script uses export to set a variable, WILL NOT SET THE VARIABLE

You can use . though, because it's the same thing as sourcing

In python, the function `os.getenv` is used to get the value of an *environment variable*. The first parameter is the name of the variable, and the second parameter is a default value to use if the environment variable has not been set.

Ex.

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ cat > quiz.py <<'EOF'
3 import os
4 print(os.getenv('message', 'hola mundo'))
5 EOF
6 $ message="hello world" python3 quiz.py
```

outputs `hello world`

and

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ message="hello world"
3 $ cat > quiz.py <<EOF
4 import os
5 print(os.getenv('message', 'hola mundo'))
6 EOF
7 $ python3 quiz.py
```
outputs `hola mundo` - this is because "hello world" isn't an environmental variable here

and

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ message="hello world"
3 $ cat > quiz.py <<'EOF'
4 import os
5 print(os.getenv('message', 'hola mundo'))
6 EOF
7 $ python3 quiz.py
```

also outputs `hola mundo` - it doesn't matter that variable substitution isn't happening in the heredoc because hola mundo is the default—there isn't any substitution to happen

Forgetting quotation marks around a variable definition is a common syntax mistake that results in accidentally using the command prefix environment variable notation. The results are usually quite unexpected and difficult to debug.

For example- here's a crazy weird situation that comes from running the block he has.

```
quiz %  cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
quiz % var=echo echo echo
echo
quiz % touch "$var"
quiz % ls
hello $place?hola $place?salve $place
```

Kinda crazy right??

## Relevant Notes

12. `*` is the glob- make sure you always understand it
13. matches any set of characters- it can expand to nothing too
14. it's differet than the `*` in regex
    1. in regex, `*` is an operator- takes parameters and modifies the previous command
        1. so "e* " means 0 or more e characters
    2. but in the shell e* means it starts with an e, then has 0 or more of any characters
        1. so * in shell is .* in regex
15. this quiz focuses on weird glob edge cases
16. one weird thing- it does not expand in ANY quotation marks- single or double
17. echo * makes all the files display
18. even though it won't display in echo glob recreates, glob does include them in the expansion
19. remember touch only creates a file when the name is unique- otherwise it updates the timestamp
20. when there's no files in the folder, `touch *` just creates a file named `*`
21. unifying principle of unix- avoid error messages and always do stuff
    1. absolute opposite of modern programming principles
22. the glob will always result in at least one parameter being passed to a program 
23. the glob happens before you run the program
24. remember you can check exit codes with `echo $?`
25. glob works the way you'd expect/hope inside of for loops
26. interesting stuff- 2-3 quiz problems come from this section- it's really easy to make mistakes here
27. `rm *` will not work to remove directories
    1. this is a property of the rm program, not the glob
    2. you've gotta do `rm -r {folder}` - -r means 
28. echo lists files in alphabetical order
29. think through glob programs in steps
30. just because it expands to files, it doesn't have to be interpreted as such- could be a flag instead for instance
31. the order of expansion of * isn't defined in POSIX, but bash expands asciibetically- this doesn't matter though because usually programs don't care about order of arguments
32. so how do you delete files that look like flags?
    1. standard- `rm ./-rf`
33. difference between -r and -rf
    1. -r is recursively delete all folders, -f is force delete without asking
    2. you might need to do -f to delete some folders
34. `--` is a GNU specific extension- means all subsequent parameters are treated as files
    1. this gives you another way to delete files that start with `-`
35. git time!
36. we have to know git commit -m, git ranch, git checkout, and git checkout -h
37. these problems are straightforward though
38. `ls -a` shows you all the hidden files - all the stuff that starts with a `.`
39. `.` is the current folder `..` is the parent folder
40. but don't forget that the `.git` folder exists ! could mess up your `ls -a` answers
41. `git status`- side effect free - files are unobserved and untracked by git
42. added but not committed is the 'staging area for git'
43. two main concepts in git - commit and branch
    1. a branch is a reference to a particular commit
44. `git branch` lists all the branches and tells you what branch you're at
45. git commit only updates the current branch you have checked out
46. the subtleties are usually just what's in the staging area and what isn't
47. if you don't commit stuff, switch branches, add it, then switch back, it won't remember those files

## Notes on Quizzes

Putting a carat inside of brackets in regex negates the entire bracketed expression.

Ex.

```
$ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
$ touch hello world
$ touch hola mundo
$ touch salve munde
$ echo *[^eo]
hola world
```

Glob does not by default look at dotfiles. 
Also, remember with these problems that all folders have a `.` and `..` file.

Ex.

```
$ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
$ touch .hello world
$ touch .hola mundo
$ touch .salve munde
$ rm *e*
$ ls -a | wc -l
7
$ ls -a
.  ..  .hello  .hola  mundo  .salve  world
```

If you want to search for these you need to put a . in the glob operator.

`?` is the wildcard character- it matches exactly one of any character.

Remember- glob expansion happens in the shell before anything is passed to the program.

Touch can't create directories.

Ex.

```
$ touch test/'hello world'
touch: cannot touch 'test/hello world': No such file or directory
```

You can create and switch to a new branch at the same time by using the `-b` flag on `checkout`.

Ex.

```
$ git checkout -b foo
Switched to a new branch 'foo'
```
## Notes From Class

5. the shell is a programming environment
6. in shell you create lists using spaces
    1. `a b c d e f` is a list of length 6
7. you can do for loops in multiple lines and it's nicer for coding
8. `do` puts you in the body of a file

Ex.

```
quiz % for file in a b c d e f;             
for> do touch $file;
for> done
quiz % ls
a	b	c	d	e	f
```

9. if you don't do the variable substitution here, the code will just make 6 files named file
10. quotation marks group variables in for loops
11. but because these are envronment variables yuo need to put your variable in quotation marks to honor those groupings
12. in the if statement, the block is started by `then` as opposed to `do` in for loops
13. in the shell you can re-use keywords and it's chill
14. you end if statements with `fi`
15. the check for equality here is `=`
16. make sure to list all of your files

9. remember basic syntax
    1. `if [ condition ]; then executable fi`
        1. you have to have spaces between the brackets for this to work
    2. single equals is equality operator
    3. in the shell there's no restrictions on keywords
    4. people lose a lot of points on how variable substitution happens- 
    5. idempotent- side-effect free commands
10. on his gh, he has a project called quiz where you can find all of the pdfs and the test harnesses
11. `else` and `elif` do what you'd think they'd do
12. first thing to look at in a heredoc -are there single quotes? if so we don't have variable substitutions
12. `||` - the or operator in the shell
    1. this is the c and java or operator
13. sometimes commands get absorbed- that's just a terminal effect, the shell remembers don't worry
14. remember- if you have a heredoc without variable substitution, **all** variables will get substituted
15. to make files executable you need to add a shebang at the top
    1. ie `#! /bin/sh` - common way to make them executable - this is the dash program that will execute the script
16. `&&` means and - every language before python used this
17. `true` and `false` have the semantics you'd expect
18. `!` means not
19. outside and inside square brackets is semantically equal for where to put the `!`
20. short circuiting - feature of nearly every language, but usually considered bad form, but in the shell it's good form
    1.  most important thing to have down
    2. if you're doing a conditoinal and the whole expression's truth value is determined from just looking at the left side, you never evaluate the right sign
    3. ex. ` false || echo hola' yields hola, and `true || echo hola` yields nothing
        1. this applies all the time, not just in line
21. or and and look at the 'exit code' of the previous program- exit code of 0 is success, 1 is failure - backwards of python
22. to inspect exit code, run `$?` - tells you exit code of previous command
23. when a quiz problem has ls at the end, CHECK CAREFULLY FOR ALL FILES
24. special file `/dev/null` - any time we don't care about the output, only the exit code, we put it in null
    1. it automatically deletes anything you put in it

## Notes from Practice Quizzes

The following runs differently on bash and zsh

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ for file in 'a b' 'c d' 'e f'; do touch $file; done
3 $ ls | wc -l
```

On bash, the single grouping quotation marks aren't honored and six files are created. On zsh, they are and three files are created. So in this case the correct answer to the problem is 3 because the $'s indicate that this is being run in a bash terminal.

If you put $file in double quotes the single quote grouping will be honored. But be careful! If you put it in single quotes, nothing will get substituted and you'll just create a file named $file 6 times.

Reminder for what the if statement syntax is exactly

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ foo='hola'
3 $ cat > quiz.sh <<'EOF'
4 foo='hello'
5 if [ $foo = "hello" ]; then
6   touch if
7 fi
8 EOF
9 $ sh quiz.sh
10 $ ls
```

If there's no single quotes around the `EOF`, all variables will be substituted for placeholders upon the creation of the file.

The short circuiting behavior also applied for if statements. 

Ex.

```
1 $ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
2 $ cat > logs <<EOF
3 INFO: blah
4 INFO: blah
5 WARNING: blah blah blah
6 INFO: blah
7 EOF
8 $ cat > quiz.sh <<'EOF'
9 if cat logs | grep ERROR > /dev/null; then
10 touch error
11 elif cat logs | grep WARNING > /dev/null; then
12 touch warning
13 elif cat logs | grep INFO > /dev/null; then
14 touch info
15 fi
16 EOF
17 $ sh quiz.sh
18 $ ls
```

This will stop after finding a warning file. So the output will just be `logs quiz.sh warning`

Kinda crazy right??

**UPDATE**

Turns out this is weird zsh behavior.
If you do the *exact same thing* in bash, this is what happens

```
$ cd; rm -rf quiz; mkdir quiz; cd quiz
$ var=echo echo echo
echo
$ touch "$var"
touch: cannot touch '': No such file or directory
$ ls
```
