1. One more quiz on locks next week!
2. this time he'll be flexible on annotations but not next time
3. spaces don't really matter in sql
4. postgres is the only rmdbs that lets you do anything in transactions
5. data definition command- any command that modifies the schema
6. deferrable initially deferred also impacts other transactions
7. you'd use deferrable when there are lots of transactions that are likely to abort
8. you can't have multiple constraint checks happening at different times
    1. ie no deferrable and uniques on two different tables
9. only use block annotation on the things that do the blocking
10. irl you have sql integrated into python and commands are interleaved in arbitrary orders- going from that code to understanding the ordering is hard
11. if the values aren't static they won't meet delete conditions
12. once locks are released we re-check condition *only* on locked rows
13. if you have a repeatable read and the re-checking finds a different value you'll get an error
14. we have two weeks for this assignment and no lab assignment tomorrow
