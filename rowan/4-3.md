1. next quiz is going to be a *lot* harder - many more gotchas
2. reminder- if multiple tables are created make sure to pay attention to which one we're writing to
3. session- individual connection to postgres, transaction
4. insert output tells you how many rows were deleted and then inserted
5. remember- transactions that haven't been committed yet can NEVER be viewed
6. in PSQL- any time a command errors it aborts the transaction
7. if you type commands while something is blocked those commands run when the lock is released
8. acid guarantee - atomicity, consistency, isolation durability
    1. c- only certain types of data are allowed - postgres has the strongest c guarantee
    2. a - if you're adding multiple information, either all are added or none are
    3. i - transactions in process are isolated
    4. d - committed data is saved so even if the system majorly fails the data is available in a correct state - postgres has a very strong guarantee, 3-4 bugs in 40 years, mysql has thousands of these bugs
9. nosql databases aren't acid compliant usually- they're faster but not worth it
10. json - most denormalized form of data
11. in postgres we store them in JSONB columns- it's json + binary formatted
    1. mongodb was so popular because it could do json and mongo couldn't- now pg supports it though
12. don'nt ever use string subsittituion to build up sql databasess- makes you vulnerable to injection attacks
