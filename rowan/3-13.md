1. last quiz that tests you on correctness of sql queries
2. no new sql material for pagila hw 3 and the lab
3. the problems are just harder
4. we care about schemas for disk space reasons- this helps us make queries fast too
5. how to make extra overhead
    1. overhead that doesn't store data- no penalties for getting rid of this
        1. row overhead
        2. page overhead
    2. redundant data
6. schema of the db is the most important part of the company- if you know the schema you know all their code
7. bad programmers care about code, good programmers care about data structures
8. on the quiz we're responsible to figure out how many bytes are used by a row of data in postgres
9. postgres has more overhead per row than other dbs- not that much  but adds up
    1. they care about simplicity and correctness more than efficiency
    2. we don't have to know this for other dbs
10. every row inserted has 3 parts
    1. header
        1. 23 byte structure called HeapTubleHeaderData
        2. null bitmap- 1 bit per column in table
        3. remembec- 8 bits in a byte and we only address bytes usually- so null bitmap is rounded up to bytes
        4. on 64 bit machine (all modern machines) we usually address 8 bytes at a timeâ€”means size of header must be divisible by 8
            1. if not add padding to make it div by 8
        5. so you get 8 columns for 24 bytes
        6. max of 256 columns per table
    2. data
        1. every column with non-null value requires bytes depending on column type
        2. null values consume 0 bytes disk space- pg knows they're not present bc of null bitmap
        3. `select typname,typalign,typlen from pg_type;` always gives you information- tells you how many bytes each data type stores per row
        4. the typlen just tells you how many bytes there are to stoer the data type
        5. typname is the name of the type
        6. negative length means the length is variable
        7. typalign- the alignment required when storing a value of this type
            1. certain datatypes can't exist in certain regions of memory
            2. you can have c-no alignment, s-2, i-4, d-8
            3. being aligned on a byte means that the end byte of the prev value must be a multiple of this number
                1. if it's not, add padding until it gets there
        8. order you put in columns determines storage and eventually runtime optimizations
        9. we're never going to be asked how many bytes a variable type takes up
    3. padding
        1. every row must be divisible by 8
11. sql has column relations
12. you can specify that a column is nullable using `NULL` and `NOT NULL`- still takes up space in the null bitmap though
