1. never have a timestamp without a timezone
2. next quiz will be a lot easier if you read and take notes on documentation
    1. he wants transaction and explicit locking
3. we're responsible for read uncommitted, read committed, and repeatable read isolation levels
4. postgres documentation is amazing- use it to learn how stuff works
5. explicit locks
    1. locking lets one session block another sec from fucking up
    2. rare in practice- usually we use implicit locks
    3. to record when something blocks circle it
    4. commands block when trying to lock a table in share mode when another session has it locked in exclusive mode
    5. your command will be blocked if the modes are incompatible
        1. share and exclusive are incompatible
        2. there's 8 different modes- there's a table that shows which ones are incompatible
        3. access exclusive blocks everything
6. deadlocks
    1. locking two different tables doesn't block
    2. when both sessions block each other it creates a deadlock and all the sessions are stopped
    3. deadlock detection is nondeterministic
        1. we can prove that it won't always be detected
        2. it's also random which session gets terminated
7. implicit locks
    1. commands all aquire implicit locks- insert is row exclusive
    2. everything postgres needs is in a table- `pg_locks` has all the locks
8. row-level locks
    1. row exclusive locks don't block with each other- this is so we can update different rows simultan
    2. learn about row level in the documentation
    3. commands interact with tables and rows in them- can block each other at either
9. if you make a typo in a transaction it gets aborted
