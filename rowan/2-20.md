1. remember there's no lab
2. he recommends that you do the first two sections of the hw before lab tomorrow
3. if everything works it should take less than an hour
4. this assignment usually takes about 5x longer than the last hw
5. this is the last sysadmin hw assignment- from now on we'll have an environment - the rest of the sem is sql
6. getting versions right is really hard- the best thing to do is hard-coding versions
    1. this leaves you open to security risks
7. semantic versioning
    1. version numbering system with 3 numbers- like 3.12.3
    2. first number is the major number- only increase for breaking changes
    3. second is the minor number- increment when you make a nonbreaking feature addition
    4. third is bug fixes- always both backwards and forwards compatible
8. big takeaway- boring old technology is the best technology
    1. "if something has not existed for 10 years I will not use it"
9. history of tech stacks
    1. the LAMP tech stack- linux, apache, mysql, php
        1. powered the 90s internet- big portion of the internet works on this
        2. there was a major version change from 5-6 in php that nobody liked
        3. postgres has way better data integrity- slower though
        4. facebook still uses LAP, but they've replaced mysql with a custom internal database
    2. WIMP tech stack- named by linux ppl after windows
        1. windows, iis, mysql, php- nobody uses windows so nobody cares
        2. the only website that runs on windows is stack overflow- microsoft's website runs on linux and so does outlook
        3. 3 major events shut down the internet- code red, code red ii, nimda- destroyed the stack
    3. instagram tech stack- pioneered it and it's the standard stack for startups today
        1. nginx, flask+gunicorn, pg\_bouncer, postgres
        2. divided into web service and database parts
        3. every row in the structure is a different dockerfile- each box is an instance of the dockerfile
        4. what actually happens
            1. you visit nginx- it's a load balancer that decides which web servers to send your connection to
            2. then you get to the web server- it's running python- those web servers make data requests
            3. then pg\_bouncer decides what service to go to
            4. and then the load balancer connects the server to the right db, gets filtered back up to the website
            5. there's some horizontal communication at the db level- but everything else doesn't
10. once we finish the code this will be all the code instagram has for this and we could theoretically expand to be as big as them if we wanted to
11. nginx
    1. technically a 'reverse proxy'- more than a load balancer- does low-level network stuff and encryption/decryption
    2. the number 1 webserver- it's a russian owned company, but fully open sourced so we're not worried about backdoors particularly- they also aren't friends with the russian government
12. django
    1. in 2011 it was the only python web framework- it's very heavyweight
    2. the only people who use it now are the people who used it in 2011
    3. so we're using flask instead- faster and easier
    4. WSGI - pronounced 'whiskey' - web server gateway interface- flask is a wsgi application
    5. werkzeug- wsgi wrapper used by a lot of libraries
    6. asgi- replacing wsgi- asynchronous server gateway interface
        1. faster and more complicated
        2. fastAPI - spiritual successor of flask and it's asgi compatible
13. gunicorn
    1. green unicorn
    2. sits on top of any wsgi application
    3. takes the wsgi interface and turns it into a web server
    4. process-based because of python
    5. way more efficient than flasks web server- only use for development
14. pg\_bouncer + postgres
    1. way more efficient than sqlite for large scale applications
    2. most of class is focused on this
    3. we'll use sqlalchemy to interact with the database from the webapp
15. front end is more focused on interface between web service and user device- back end is from database to server
16. people aren't in charge of devices, they're in charge of interfaces
17. everyone uses docker now- nobody directly deploys to AWS
    1. it's easier to transfer your hosting provider
    2. cloud providers can shut you down whenever
18. the purpose of docker compose it to replaces the hash and arcane commands with semantically meaningful command
19. adding `-p` lets you make folders recursively
20. `ls -R` shows a whole repository
21. docker compose just works through a yaml file named `docker-compose.yml`- setup is really easy

```
services:
    web:
      build: ./services/web
```
22. docker-compose got deleted like a year ago- now you have to do `docker compose` - it's not backwards compatible
