1. We have three weeks to do this homework - computation times should last a long time- potentially over a week
    1. now due 25 february
    2. there is still a lab tomorrow! just no pre-lab work this week
2. this homework is with a huge dataset for us- 3tb
3. ls -R - lists everything recursively
4. remember you can put a path instead of just a file name in the `vim` command - this is true for ls too
5. `cd -` takes you back to your previous directory
6. all operations need to be constant memory
7. POSIX command for unzipping- `unzip -p`
8. you can use all the same piping commands here as normal
9. The language code "zxx" is used to indicate that a resource has no linguistic content
10. general solution for stopping a program - controlz, find pid, kill it
11. Counter is a great way to store stuff- import it!
    1. it's a special built in data type that doesn't get covered in intro classes
    2. just a dictionary where every key has a default value of zero
12. you always wanna store intermediate stuff in json
