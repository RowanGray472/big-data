1. today we're going to focus on how to use llms nice- getting 90% of the way there in 5 minutes doesn't help
2. clicking on documentation is really really important
3. half the problems on pagila hw 2 is stuff we aren't going to explicitly cover- LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTATION
4. if you want to pipe something into vim to read it you need to pipe it into `vim -`
5. cxml is another useful way to pipe stuff into models- use `--cxml` or `-c`
6. sqlite is smaller and standalone- it's easier to embed inside of other programs- like python- postgres needs more complicated setups
7. claude has a huge context window of 200 mil tokens but it can get confused
8. new model- speculative decoding- doesn't change the answer but the output is about 10x faster- about 1600 tokens per second
9. remember- `USING` is syntactic sugar for a where clause plus cross join
10. `NULL` is equivalent to false inside of where clauses
11. postgres can help us with stuff like this - doesn't have to eval long things when the outcome is determined in advance
12. git is a protocol not a website
13. he encouraes you to find all the easy way to do things- use llms if they can save you time
14. back and forth with llms can solve every pagila hw problems
15. his recommendation is to try to do about half of them manually and even numbered ones with the llm workflow so as to get practice with both workflows
    1. you can also try it by yourself and then try it with the llm
16. understanding the sql subtelties can help you prompt claude too
