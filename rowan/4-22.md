1. he's not rounding grades- that's what ec is for
2. about50% of the grade is upcoming
3. no lab friday may 2nd
4. next two quizzes are on tuesdays- both worth 16 points
5. final proj
    1. create your own database backed website from scratch using the instagram architecture
    2. create, read, update, destroy - everything you'd do in a database
    3. design your own db schema
    4. this should be production-ready
6. due date is any time during finals week where we can demo it to him
    1. these can be over zoom
7. there's a list of 8 required tasks- there are strong references
8. he has a recommended timeline
9. twitter postgres indexes
    1. extension of the last ones
    2. now we're actually running select queries- we're using 31 mil tweets
    3. do not wait until the last minute- puts lots of load on lambda, more than mapreduce
10. raw intelligence is not what you need, it's good habits
11. some constraints create indexes on columns
    1. primary key (unique + not null)
    2. foreign key/references - the value to the right has to have a unique constraint on it
    3. all unique constraints create an index- idx
    4. `CREATE INDEX {tablename}({colname})`
    5. adding `UNIQUE` before the tablename creates a unique index inside of the table
    6. only the primary key creates indexes because it's the only one that creates a unique constraint
    7. where primary key is specified doesn't matter
        1. if you want multiple columns in it you have to do it at the end
        2. order of columns has semantic meaning performance-wise
    8. this all hepls us understand what queries are going fast
12. scan methods
    1. 
13. table scanning strategies
    1. the procedure of getting information from heap pages into psql
    2. sequential scan
        1. can always be used
        2. linear
    3. index scan
        1. we have an index btree structure 
        2. it has a high fanout size because disk access is a lot more expensive than comparison
        3. you can only use it when we have where clause has a created index on the table and column
        4. out of the four the index value is one of the most flexbible
    4. index only scan
        1. same condition as index scan
        2. the only information in the index *itself* is the information you specified in the creation of the index itself- only the column you said, not other info in the row
        3. this scan looks only at the index itself, not the heap table
            1. this makes this *really* efficient
        4. implies an index is possible
    5. bitmap scan
        1. most complicated- requires the index scan
        2. still traverse index
        3. before looking at heap page, construct the bitmap
            1. size of bitmap is # of pages in table
            2. 1 if corresponding has a tuple we'll need, else 0
            3. we start with an all zero bitmap, when we do the traversal we can see which block the tuple is in in the heap map- it has the tuple id
        4. if we're returning lots of results we'll have to access the same page multiple times- doesn't make sense to look at the page thousands of times
        5. then we access all pages iwth 1 and check all tuples for condition- constructig the bitmap means we discard the tuple information
        6. if you can do an index scan you can do a bitmap scan
    6. seq is always possible, then bitmap, then index, then index only
14. how to enable idx only scans?
    1. you have to create an index that has all the information you need
    2. `CREATE INDEX ON users(id_user, username)`
    3. has all the benefits of the index scan too- means it's always the best
15. bitmap vs index
    1. idx benefits- sorted outputs, can do one at a time
    2. bitmap- accesses fewer pages, so faster
16. order of columns
    1. you order first on the first column, use the second to break ties
    2. in the cerate index the first entry needs to match what's in the where clause- this guarantees you'll get log speed
    3. so if you use it for search in an index it won't speed up the query
17. you can make bitmaps in lots of ways
    1. we can construct it on each clause of the conditions separately
    2. this is where they become really useful- we can compare them without having to check the data, only the indices
    3. so complex where clauses are really useful for bitmaps
