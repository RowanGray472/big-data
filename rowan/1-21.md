8. going to do a lot of llm stuff
9. we're gonna replicate the instagram tech stack
10. no textbook
11. we're going to only use foss tools

    1. labs quizzes and homeworks
    2. weekly homeworks are the most important parts
    3. nongraduators have a final project - we can do a mock technical interview if we want
13. all code and no math this sem
14. technical time
15. first quiz is next week
16. there's a lot of pre-lab work - it's getting lambda account set up
17. do it before wednesday
18. quizzes are fully open notes but we can only use printed material
19. all of the quizzes are looking at a piece of code and saying what it'll output
20. main purpose of the course- doing pair programming with him for four hours a week
21. command names are short bc early computers had so little memory
22. linux- variation of unix - in this class they're interchangeable
23. principles of unix phil
    1. write programs that do one thing and do it well
    2. write programs to work together
    3. write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface
24. echo prints to stdout - standard out
25. by default it's the screen - TTY - stands for teletype
26. `>>` redirects stdout to a file - appends
27. cat outputs content of a file
28. `|` is called a pipe - takes the output of a previous command and puts it into the right command
29. just running grep opens a new interface for you to type in so that it can search through it
30. `^` means control
31. grep outputs the whole line, if it contains the specified phrase
32. grep does two things - it loads a file and searches - this means it doesn't conform with unix philosophy
33. input redirection with < - pass contents of a file to the input of a program - so `< readme` is the same as `cat readme |`
34. `>` output redirection but deletes the contents of the file first
35.
